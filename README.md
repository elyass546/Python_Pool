## Daily Overview

### Day 00: Python Basics
Learn the fundamentals of Python programming, including:
- Writing basic Python scripts.
- Using built-in libraries for formatting dates and processing data types.
- Creating and using simple functions to analyze objects.

*Key Exercises:*
- First Python script.
- Formatting dates and types.
- Checking even and odd numbers.

---

### Day 01: Arrays and Image Manipulation
Explore Python arrays and manipulate image data:
- Slice and reshape 2D arrays.
- Load and process images in various formats.
- Apply transformations like zoom, rotate, and color filtering.

*Key Exercises:*
- Working with 2D arrays.
- Loading and manipulating images.
- Applying filters to images.

---

### Day 02: Dataset Loading and Visualization
Work with datasets using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib:
- Load CSV files and handle errors.
- Visualize data trends over time.
- Compare datasets across different categories or countries.

*Key Exercises:*
- Loading datasets and checking dimensions.
- Plotting data for life expectancy and population.
- Exploring correlations between datasets.

---

### Day 03: Object-Oriented Programming
Dive into Python's object-oriented programming (OOP):
- Create and use classes with inheritance.
- Implement abstract classes and method overriding.
- Use Python's OOP to build calculators and manage data efficiently.

*Key Exercises:*
- Building and extending character classes (e.g., Stark, Baratheon).
- Implementing vector calculators with scalar and dot product operations.

---

### Day 04: Data-Oriented Design
Master advanced programming techniques:
- Write functions using decorators and closures.
- Create data classes to manage structured data.
- Calculate statistical metrics from datasets with error handling.

*Key Exercises:*
- Calculating statistics (mean, median, quartiles, etc.).
- Creating a decorator to limit function calls.
- Managing student data with Python's dataclasses.
