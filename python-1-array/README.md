## General Rules

- Use *Python 3.10* for all exercises.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Follow Python best practices for imports, naming conventions, and file organization.
- Each script must have a main() function and a __doc__ string for documentation.
- Use flake8 for linting (pip install flake8).
- Test your code thoroughly before submission.

---

## Specific Instructions of the Day

- No code should exist in the global scope; everything must be inside functions.
- Use Python's slicing methods and libraries like numpy where allowed.
- Handle errors gracefully and display clear error messages.

---

### Exercise 02: Load my Image
- *Directory*: ex02/
- *File*: load_image.py
- *Goal*: Load an image and display its format, shape, and RGB pixel data.

---

### Exercise 03: Zoom on Me
- *Directory*: ex03/
- *Files*: load_image.py, zoom.py
- *Goal*: Load an image, zoom into a specific region, and display it.

---

### Exercise 04: Rotate Me
- *Directory*: ex04/
- *Files*: load_image.py, rotate.py
- *Goal*: Rotate an image by transposing its array representation manually.

---

### Exercise 05: Pimp my Image
- *Directory*: ex05/
