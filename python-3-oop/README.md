## General Rules

- Use *Python 3.10* for all exercises.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Follow Python best practices for imports, naming conventions, and file organization.
- Each script must have a main() function and a __doc__ string for documentation.
- Use flake8 for linting (pip install flake8).
- Test your code thoroughly before submission.

---

## Specific Instructions of the Day

- Write clean and reusable object-oriented code.
- Avoid "hard coding" or "shitcode" — strive for efficient and elegant solutions.
- Ensure that all classes, methods, and functions are documented with clear __doc__ strings.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: GOT S1E9
- *Directory*: ex00/
- *File*: S1E9.py
- *Goal*: Create an abstract Character class and a Stark class that inherits from it. Implement methods to manage the state of a character's life.

---

### Exercise 01: GOT S1E7
- *Directory*: ex01/
- *Files*: Files from previous exercises + S1E7.py
- *Goal*: Add Baratheon and Lannister classes that inherit from Character. Implement __str__, __repr__, and class methods to instantiate objects.

---

### Exercise 02: Now it’s Weird!
- *Directory*: ex02/
- *Files*: Files from previous exercises + DiamondTrap.py
- *Goal*: Create a King class that inherits from Baratheon and Lannister. Use properties to modify and access physical attributes like eyes and hairs.

---

### Exercise 03: Calculate my Vector
- *Directory*: ex03/
- *File*: ft_calculator.py
- *Goal*: Write a Calculator class to perform scalar operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on vectors.

---

### Exercise 04: Calculate my Dot Product
- *Directory*: ex04/
- *File*: ft_calculator.py
- *Goal*: Extend the Calculator class to include operations like dot product, vector addition, and vector subtraction using decorators.

---

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your work in the assigned Git repository. Only files in the repository will be graded.
- Ensure all files are named correctly and placed in their respective directories.
- Test your solutions with peers for better feedback.
