## General Rules

- Use *Python 3.10* for all exercises.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Follow Python best practices for imports, naming conventions, and file organization.
- Each script must have a main() function and a __doc__ string for documentation.
- Use flake8 for linting (pip install flake8).
- Test your code thoroughly before submission.

---

## Specific Instructions of the Day

- No code should exist in the global scope; everything must be inside functions.
- Write clean and efficient code, avoiding "shitcode" and hardcoding values.
- Use functional programming techniques, decorators, and data classes where applicable.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Calculate my Statistics
- *Directory*: ex00/
- *File*: statistics.py
- *Goal*: Implement a function that calculates statistical measures (mean, median, quartiles, standard deviation, variance) from input data and handles errors gracefully.

---

### Exercise 01: Outer and Inner Functions
- *Directory*: ex01/
- *File*: in_out.py
- *Goal*: Write functions to calculate the square and exponentiation of a number, and an outer function to manage the computation using closures.

---

### Exercise 02: My First Decorating
- *Directory*: ex02/
- *File*: callLimit.py
- *Goal*: Create a decorator that limits the number of times a function can be called.

---

### Exercise 03: Data Class
- *Directory*: ex03/
- *File*: new_student.py
- *Goal*: Use Python's dataclasses module to create a Student class with attributes for name, nickname, login, and a randomly generated ID.

---

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your work in the assigned Git repository. Only files in the repository will be graded.
- Ensure all files are named correctly and placed in their respective directories.
- Test your solutions with peers for better feedback.
